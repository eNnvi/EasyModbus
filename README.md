# EasyModbus
Easymodbus is a modbus master library for Arduino.

It's been written to be quite easy to use and implement.

## Todo list

- [ ] Write every method for ModbusRTU
- [ ] Write ASCII version of the library (methods have to be the same)
- [ ] Create some examples
- [ ] Publish schematics for connection


## Description

This library allows you to control a YL620 VFD (Variable frequency drive) with an Arduino connected via Modbus control.

At this stage most of the main VFD functions are available (like start, stop, set speed, read speed, acceleration and deceleration, parameters set, ecc...).

## This library is still under development
